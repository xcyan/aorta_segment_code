1) Copy data files 'vasc_GS_?.mat' and 'VLCrulers.mat' to the root directory
2) Run 'startup.m'
3) Run 'demo_submodel_model.m': it takes some time to preprocess the data
4) Run 'demo_joint_model.m': it takes some time to load learned submodels

Please feel free to email me (skywalkeryxc@gmail.com) if you find some bugs in the code.
Thanks very much!
